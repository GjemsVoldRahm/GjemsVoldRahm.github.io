					<p>Before rushing like fools and assaulting the dataset with a plethora of fancy data analysis tools, let’s just take a step back and travel back in time throughout the whole period during which the statements were made. As it was mentioned in the introduction, this period ranges from 2007 up until 2016. While this is nowhere near being some obscure ancient history subject which we studied at school years ago, a quick refresher will surely be a sensible thing to do in order to set everything in context. Our time travel machine will be the <b><font color="purple">w</font><font color="orange">o</font><font color="brown">r</font><font color="gray">d</font> <font color="DEEPPINK">c</font><font color="INDIANRED">l</font><font color="red">o</font><font color="green">u</font><font color="blue">d</font></b> map of the USA on the right. Not the fanciest machine but, eh, it’s taking us where we want, right? Unlike politicians… Without further ado, let’s hop on the <b><font color="purple">w</font><font color="orange">o</font><font color="brown">r</font><font color="gray">d</font> <font color="DEEPPINK">c</font><font color="INDIANRED">l</font><font color="red">o</font><font color="green">u</font><font color="blue">d</font></b> and go <img src="img/back-to-the-past.png" title="WordCloud" height="40px" /> !</p>

					<p>Two of the words that pop out the most are <b><font color="#e6ab02">Barack Obama</font></b> and <b><font color="#1b9e77">health care</font></b>. It’s no wonder since the former was president during most of the period 2007-2016 and the latter was one of his greatest fight. During his two terms in the oval office, Barack Obama, being at the head of the country, was the target of many criticism, both positive and negative, and was in this sense a hot topic by himself. Specifically in the domain of health care, as he managed to set in place what was called <b><font color="#656565">ObamaCare</font></b>, a health care reform whose goal was to enlarge the population of Americans covered by insurance. As this was closely related to taxes and to the debate of a strong vs weak government, it was a highly controversial subject and caused a lot of ink to flow.</p>

				<p>After looking at the big words, one might be wondering where two names, omnipresent in the news during the past three years, are hidden on the map: <b><font color="#168967">Donald Trump</font></b> (below "American") and <b><font color="#5a5a5a">Hillary Clinton</font></b> (below "year"). Indeed, they startle us here because of their relatively small size with respect to some other words. Nevertheless, the explanation for that is actually obvious: the time span of the statements only includes part of the campaign for the 2016 presidential elections and none of the events that took place with Trump in the white house! The reader shall bear that in mind throughout the data story as what the data analysis will point out might not align with his expectations, which are also based on his knowledge of what came after 2016.</p>

					<p>Finally, we'll focus on some of the smaller words. First of all, it must be reminded that, in 2008, one of the biggest financial crisis ever initiated in the US. It plunged the world into a global recession and was the most important topic for some times. This is illustrated by numerous words like <b><font color="#66a61e">job</font></b>, <b><font color="#666666">money</font></b>, <b><font color="#d95f02">taxes</font></b>, <b><font color="#66a61e">unemployment</font></b>, <b><font color="#d95f02">debt</font></b> and so on. Secondly, as the statements are all about american politics, we can find some of their favorite topics, such as <b><font color="#7570b3">gun</font></b> or <b><font color="#a6761d">abortion</font></b>. Third, we can find some less prominent american politicians like (<b><font color="#e7298a">Mitt Romney</font></b> (who ran for president against Barack Obama in 2012), <b><font color="#a6761d">Rick Perry</font></b> (former Governor of <b><font color="#1b9e77">Texas</font></b>) and <b><font color="#1b9e77">Scott Walker</font></b> (Governor of <b><font color="#d95f02">Wisconsin</font></b>))</p>
