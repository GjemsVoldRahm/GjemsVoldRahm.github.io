				<p>Even though these statements were produced before 2016, fake news are no less relevant today. President Donald Trump has already shown he's prone to lies, and there seems to be little to no evidence of him turning honest since he took up residence in the White House in 2016. Fake news became a global subject and was widely introduced as a subject mainly due to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Numerous political commentators and journalists wrote and stated in media that 2016 was the year of fake news and as a result politics would never be the same.</p>
				<p>Trump himself claims that the mainstream American media regularly reports fake news. He has carried on a war against the mainstream media, often attacking it as "fake news" and the "enemy of the people". According to university professor Jeff Hemsley, who studies social media, Trump uses the term "fake news" for any news that is not favorable to him, or which he simply dislikes. On May 9, 2018, Trump wrote a tweet on Twitter:</p>
				<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/994179864436596736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

				<p>Chris Cillizza, an American politcal commentator for CNN, described the tweet as an "accidental revelation about Trump's "'fake news' attacks'", and wrote: "The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump: 'negative (Fake)'. To Trump, those words mean the same thing. Negative news coverage is fake news. [...]"</p>
				<p>So when reading and listening to politicians, you might want to keep in mind what you've just read, and take what they say with a pinch of salt.</p>
