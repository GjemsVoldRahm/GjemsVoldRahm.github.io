					<center><h1>Getting started</h1></center>
					<p>Lately, the world has witnessed a growing epidemic of fake news. In the current era of social media and instant connectivity, the impact of fake news is greater than ever. Not only does it pose a threat to the integrity of journalism, it also creates disturbances and uncertainties in the political world. What's alarming is when people believe what they read, and act upon it. For these reasons, the spotlight needs to be set on fake news. The LIAR dataset for fake news detection, created by William Yang Wang at the University of California in Santa Barbara, will be used in this data story to study the world of fake news in the political scene of America. Let's dive in, shall we?</p>

								<p>As defined by its author, the LIAR dataset is a "new benchmark dataset for fake news detection". It consists of almost 13'000 short statements from various contexts made between 2007 and 2016. The statements have been manually labeled for truthfulness, topic, context, speaker, state, and party and are well distributed over these different features. To illustrate that, the table to the right shows a sample statement from Donald Trump along with its features.</p>

					<p>To warm up and get more familiar with the data, we will start by vizualizing how the values of the statements are distributed. For this purpose, the six pie charts below show how the statements are caracterized. For instance, who made it, what was it about and how truthful was it?</p>
